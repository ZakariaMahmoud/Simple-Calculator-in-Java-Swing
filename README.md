# Simple Calculator in Java Swing

#### Project Presentation

- This project is a simple calculator programmed with **Java Swing.**

#### Technologies Used

- **Java Language** : Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
- **Swing Class** : Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes – an API for providing a graphical user interface for Java programs. Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit.
- **Awt Class** : The Abstract Window Toolkit is Java's original platform-dependent windowing, graphics, and user-interface widget toolkit, preceding Swing. The AWT is part of the Java Foundation Classes — the standard API for providing a graphical user interface for a Java program.
